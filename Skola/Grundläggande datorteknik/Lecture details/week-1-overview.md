**Learning objectives of the week -** **After the first week of study, you should be able to**:

*   Convert number values between different number systems.
*   Explain the function of the basic logic gates
*   Draw wiring diagrams for simple digital grids.
*   Describe some basic binary codes: base 2, NBCD code, ASCII code, Partity code, Gray code, and Excess code.
*   Use Boolean algebra to describe and analyze simple digital grids.
*   Use function tables and binary evaluation to analyze digital grids.
