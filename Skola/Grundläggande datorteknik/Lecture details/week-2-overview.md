Week 2 (Overview)
=================

**Elements & Concepts - Study week 2**

*   Minimizing gate networks and boolean expressions. Karnaugh's method. Construction of NAND and NOR logic.
*   Design of code converters, encoders, selectors and distributors.
*   Minimizing gate networks using don't care terms.
*   Binary arithmetic.
*   Two-complement representation. General _rn_\-representation for numbers expressed in base _r_.
*   Arithmetic with two complementary numbers. Status flags: N, Z, V, C
*   Half-adder, full Adder. 4-bit full Adder, subtracter
*   Multplexer, Demultiplexer, Decoders, ALU

**Learning objectives of the week -** **After the second week of study, you should be able to**:

*   Minimize gate mesh using Karnaugh diagrams.
*   Use don't care terms to produce minimal gate meshes.
*   Design decoders, encoders, selectors, and distributors.
*   Use two-complement arithmetic.   
*   Perform additions and subtractions for signed and unsigned  numbers
*   Describe the function of the status flags N, Z, V and C.
*   Describe the function of half-adders and full adders.
