Week 3 (Overview)
=================

**Elements & Concepts - Reading week 3**

*   Sequential networks.  Latch,  flip-flops (vippor in Swedish). Level and edge-triggered flip-flips
*    Register using d flip-flop
*   Transmission gate. Three-state logic.
*   Data Bus.
*   Finite sate machines FSM
*   Analysis of counters
*   Synthesis of counters
*   Data path with registers and ALU

**Learning objectives of the week -** **After the third week of study, you should be able to**:

*   Describe the function of different types of flip-flops (vippor in Swedish) : SR- flip-flop, JK- flip-flop, T- flip-flop, D- flip-flop.
*   Produce the state graph for a given wiring diagram for a sequence network (analysis).
*   Construct the wiring diagram of a sequence grid from a given state graph (synthesis).
*   Describe the function of the transmission gate.
*   Use a simple data path to transfer data between different registries.
*   Use a simple ALU to perform arithmetic operations.

  **After the third week's lectures, demos and self-activities, you should have had time:**

*   **Course book:** Read the whole of chapters 5 and 6 and chapter 7 up to and including 7.4.3.
    
*   **Sample collection:** Solving Task **6.1.1**, 6.1.2, **6.1.3**, 6.1.4, 6.1.5, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3, 6.2.4, 6.3.1, **6.3.2**, 6.5.2, 6.6.2, 6.6.3, **7.2.2,** 7.3**.**3 [**\[****Link to the sample collection**Links to an external site.](http://www.gbgmv.se/exempelsamling-gd/index.html)**\]** 
    
*   **Assignments in the course book:** Solve problems 6.5, 6.6, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4. 7.3, 7.4, 7.10, 7.11, 7.12, 7.20, 7.22, 7.25, 7.26 (These tasks must be performed in preparation for laboratory 2.)

Assignments written in bold will be reviewed at Demonstration 3 which will be given on Thursday 20/11 at 13.15 in HB4.
