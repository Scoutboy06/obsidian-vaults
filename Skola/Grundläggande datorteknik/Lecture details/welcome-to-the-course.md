**The first lecture will be held** **on Monday 3 November at 15:15 in** **HB4 (HB3\*)**.

\*HB3 is a reserve room if it gets full in HB4. The lecture will then be streamed to HB3.

Always check [TimeEdit Links to an external site.](https://cloud.timeedit.net/chalmers/web/staff/ri15g265750Z0YQ4765065605950Z731Xy0Qg5QQYY7.html) for accurate information about the timetable.

**Summary**

In this course, you will learn the basics of digital hardware design. You construct various digital building blocks that you then use to build a simple computer. At the end of the course, you will work on writing programs in assembly language for the simple computer.

The intended learning outcomes of the course can be summarized in four points:

*   Be able to design and program a simple computer
*   Master the basics of digital hardware design
*   Be able to write simple programs in assembly code
*   Understand how hardware and software work together

The course's complete intended learning outcomes and information about course literature can be found under [**Course overview**](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36805/assignments/syllabus "Syllabus") in the menu to the left.

**Lectures (16)**

Devoted to conveying basic theoretical knowledge in the subject and examples of exercises that show how the theory can be applied.

**Demonstration exercises (7 exercises)**

Takes place in large groups and should be seen as a complement to the lectures. Mainly devoted to demonstrating solutions to practice and exam assignments, and serves as a general question time.

**Laboratory sessions (4)**

The compulsory laboratory sessions are carried out in groups of two students on hardware in the department's course laboratory. Before each laboratory session, you must solve a number of homework assignments together with your lab partner that are stated in the laboratory memo. **Before each lab session, you and your lab partner must have your solutions to the home assignments approved by a TA during a simulation exercise.** When the take-home assignments are approved, the supervisor signs a [special form (worksheet)](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36805/files/4246240?wrap=1 "LabbArbetsblad-GruDat.pdf") [Download special form (worksheet)](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36805/files/4246240/download?download_frd=1) . **If you have not had your home assignments approved, you may not complete the laboratory exercise.** During the laboratory sessions, you must show completed laboratory tasks on request and be able to answer questions about how you have solved the tasks. More information about the laboratory sessions can be found under the module [Laboratory](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36805/modules/106266 "Laborationer").

**Simulation exercises/group exercises (7 exercises)**

Devoted to preparing for the laboratory work and the exam. You have the opportunity to ask questions to the supervisors and get help if you are stuck on a task. You use the simulator software DigiFlisp to test your solutions for the labs. Digiflisp is a program that offers simulation models of the hardware you use in the labs. You can download DigiFlisp to your own computer from GMV's [website.](http://www.gbgmv.se/studies.html). DigiFlisp is available in versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**Voluntary knowledge tests before the laboratory sessions (4 pieces)**

Before each laboratory session, you have the opportunity to perform a voluntary test in Canvas. The test gives you the opportunity to check that you have mastered the theory that forms the basis of the laboratory exercise. The test consists of two multiple-choice questions, both of which must be answered correctly in order for you to pass the test. You have two attempts to pass the test, and each attempt is limited to 20 minutes. For each test you pass, you receive half a bonus point for the exam. The questions in the test are randomly selected from a database with many different questions. You can prepare for the test by taking several practice tests. More information about the knowledge tests and the related practice tests can be found in the [module Voluntary knowledge tests](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/36805/modules/106266 "Labs and Bonus points").

**Modifications this year** 

The first three laboratory exercises were simplified to minimize wiring complexity.

**Our expectations of you**

We expect you to devote approximately 40 hours per week to your studies. This corresponds to about 20 hours of independent work (preparation, reading, and solving assignments). The scheduled activities such as lectures, simulations, and demonstrations account for around 12 hours per week, meaning you should plan for an additional 8 hours of individual study time for this course.

**In a normal week, we recommend that you ...**

*   study the module "Week xx" to get a description (including reading instructions) of the elements covered during the week
*   attend the week's lectures or follow them via Zoom.
*   participate in this week's demonstration exercise in the hall or via Zoom.
*   trying to solve the tasks listed in this week's reading instructions
*   participates in this week's simulation exercise and makes sure that the solutions to the homework assignments in this week's laboratory session are approved and signed by the supervisor. (The latter is a requirement!)
*   attend this week's laboratory session (applies to study weeks 3, 4, 6, and 7) and that you and your lab partner make sure to get your worksheets signed by a supervisor when he/she has approved your solution to a laboratory assignment.
*   Take the optional test before the week's laboratory session.

### Examination

Written exams will be given on 17 January 2025, 08 April 2025 and 20 August 2025

Approved laboratory sessions (4 pieces).

The final grade is determined by the exam result.

Grade limits Chalmers and GU: 3, 4, 5
